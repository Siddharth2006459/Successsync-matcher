# 🌱 GSoC 2026 Proposal Draft — SuccessSync Matcher

## 🧩 Project Overview

SuccessSync is a matchmaking system that helps student founders, coders, and builders find ideal co-founders or collaborators based on aligned vision, skills, mindset, and risk appetite.

## 💡 Idea for GSoC

Build an open-source **web-based version** of the matcher that can:

- Collect and score user profiles
- Suggest high-match co-founders
- Let users connect securely
- Use NLP to match based on vision text similarity

## 🔨 Key Features for GSoC

- Flask or Django backend
- SQLite/PostgreSQL database
- Frontend with Streamlit or React
- OAuth Login (Google, GitHub)
- OpenAI API for idea/vision similarity
- Deployment via Render or Railway

## 📈 Impact

- Solves real pain point for student builders
- Can scale across hackathons, colleges, and research teams
- Supports mental health by reducing co-founder mismatch

## 🌍 Why GSoC?

GSoC will provide mentorship and resources to:

- Improve architecture
- Test scalability and security
- Publish open-source for global builders

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Flask
- Streamlit
- PostgreSQL
- GitHub Actions
